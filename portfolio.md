| [EE-443-Microprocessors-Labs](https://github.com/oakati/EE-443-Microprocessors-Labs)| Assembly or C programs realized on a evaluation board (De1-SoC) during the laboratory experiments of EE 443 (Microprocessors) course. 
| [LeetCode](https://github.com/oakati/LeetCode)                                                                                                                        | Solutions to LeetCode problems (written in Python)       |
| [Post-Filtering-Photographic-Tool](https://github.com/oakati/Post-Filtering-Photographic-Tool)                                                                        | About
In this project, the main aim is to utilize the OV7670 Camera Module to take a photo and display it on the VGA display using different signal processing algorithms realized on De1-SoC board using C language.      |
| [Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Calculator](https://github.com/oakati/Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Calculator)                                                          | This program is implemented as a project for EE 242 course, and it implements Normalized Power Iteration with Deflation algorithmm to calculate most dominant eigenvalue, its eigenvector and the second most dominant eigenvalue. |
| [Ansys-HFSS-Data-Extractor-Script-Generator](https://github.com/oakati/Ansys-HFSS-Data-Extractor-Script-Generator)                                                    | These Matlab programs take the matrix of design features as an input and generates scripts for data extraction in Ansys HFSS.     |
| [Linear-Equation-Solver](https://github.com/oakati/Linear-Equation-Solver)                                                                                            | This program implements the Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial pivoting together with backward substitution to solve Ax = b, where A is an n-n square matrix. The project was a part of EE 242 (Numerical Methods for EE) course.      |
| [Secant-and-Bisection-Methods](https://github.com/oakati/Secant-and-Bisection-Methods)                                                                                | This project implements secant and bisection algorithms in order to solve f(x)=0 for any given polynomial f. This project was a part of EE 242 (Numerical Methods for EE) course.      |
| [Calculating-Maximum-Sum-of-An-Orthogonal-Triangle](https://github.com/oakati/Calculating-Maximum-Sum-of-An-Orthogonal-Triangle)                                      | This program calculates the maximum sum of co-adjacent and all-non-prime numbers from top to bottom of a orthogonal pyramid. |
