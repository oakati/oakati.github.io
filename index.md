I am a senior undergraduate student in the [Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/) at [Boğaziçi Üniversitesi](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index), İstanbul, Türkiye. My expected graduation date is January 2023. I was an Erasmus student at [Politechnika Poznańska (PUT)](https://www.put.poznan.pl/en), Poznań, Poland, in Spring 2021. 

I was with [Antennas and Propagation Research Laboratory (BOUNtenna)](https://bountenna.boun.edu.tr/), İstanbul, Türkiye, as an Undergraduate Research Assistant from July 2019 to March 2022. Also, I did two internships at [Turkcell](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/english-support) and [ASELSAN](https://aselsan.com.tr/en) during the summers of 2020 and 2021, respectively.

I am currently with [Poilabs](https://www.poilabs.com/en/home/), as an embedded software developer intern. My current research interests include communication systems and embedded software development.
